To install SimpleTicket:

You must have Rails 1.1.6
You must have feed tools `gem install feedtools`

Create a database for SimpleTicket in MySQL. Custom SQL is used for the statistics
which currently require MySQL.

After creating database, copy database.example to database.yml and change the
appropriate database connection parameters.

Then run rake migrate and start the rails app (mongrel, lighttpd, apache, webrick).

Next you will need to set your outgoing mail server settings in config/environment.rb
If you do not, you will not be able to create users because users are sent an email
with their password.

We use mongrel:

gem install mongrel_cluster
cd /path/to/simpleticket
mongrel_rails start

If you want to just use webrick:
cd /path/to/simpleticket
ruby /script/server

Then visit:
http://localhost:3000/admin/

Now that you're up and running, you need to create the first company - this is YOUR company.
You will not be able to create tickets for this company at this time tickets for the "Engineer"
company must be created from the client interface.

The default administrative logon email address is "admin@example.com" and the password is "secret"
